        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello and welcome to my page about my
        research project! Research was a fun and interesting experience. At High
        Technology High School, Research Practicum is a core component of your
        time here. It teaches you about the scientific process and how to
        overcome certain obstacles to work toward your goal. In addition, it
        allows you to learn more about a field of science that may interest you.
        All in all, it's an incredible journey that I very much reccomend. This
        website documents my progress and my results throughout my research
        journey.

              controlling this species of troubling fungus a priority (Chavez,

              account the fact that another species in this class of Candida,
              Candida Nivariensis, has been able to develop resistance to
              certain drugs that were thought to have antifungal properties
              (Borman et al., 2008). This study used a direct current on a
              liquid culture of Schizosaccharomyces Pombe and investigated the
              effects of the application of such a current to the culture.
